# Starbucks_Final_Project
This is the last project I wrote when I finished the course. My project was generally written in React using HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS, Javascript, React.js and Redux Toolkit technologies.

You must install the node modules package using the "npm install" command.

Extract the Starbucks-Data file from the project files from this project, open it in the editor, install node modules with the "npm install" command and run it with the "npm start" command in the terminal. Then start the project with "npm run dev" and see my project. Thank you.
